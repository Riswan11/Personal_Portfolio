            Summer 2020, I interned at Microsoft/Cyborg-mobile as New Technologist Intern. The TNT is a
            The TNT is an innovation summer academy program for current college freshmen and sophomores interested in
            pursuing a
            career in technology. You are put in a team of 5 individuals and you get coached by Microsoft Engineers and
            Program
            Managers to learn the steps of the product development lifecycle.
            My group and I decided to use a Monopoly web-based game to address the issue of Racism geared towards middle
            school
            students because conversations about race rarely happened in school and often itâ€™s marginalized students who
            bear the
            burden of explaining their experiences in order to facilitate the learning experience of their privileged
            peers. Project
            Monopoly: educate to liberate is an educational game that models the inequalities present in the game, it
            empowers
            educators to initiate a dialogue about race and through educational resources support students as they begin
            to
            challenge their own understanding of race.
            The game requires a game to be created by a moderator to open a game lobby allowing players to join. As a
            player, you
            enter your name and chose a token, you are then randomly assigned to a team. The team is made of two teams
            that is the
            Stripe and the Stars team. The stripe team is the disadvantages, and the stars team are the advantages. The
            disadvantage
            team begin with half the wealth of the advantage team, they are not permitted to buy certain properties
            (redlining),
            they do not have access to get out of jail card etc.
            Redlining: redlining is the systematic denial of various services by federal government agencies
            Inequity: lack of fairness or justice
            Gentrification: the process of renovating and improving a house or district so that it conforms to
            middle-class taste.
            My role was to implement the monopoly board and make it appear on the game screen. I implemented an
            interface props,
            which is a sub class in typescript to keep track of the movement of the tokens on the board as a player
            click on roll
            dice using a fluent UI.
